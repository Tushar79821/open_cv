The tech stack for the provided code includes:

Python: The programming language used to write the script.
OpenCV (cv2): The Python library used for computer vision tasks such as image and video processing.
It provides functions for face detection, image manipulation, and more.
Haar Cascade Classifier: A machine learning-based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images to detect objects.
In this case, the Haar Cascade Classifier is used for face detection.
The XML file 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' contains the trained model for detecting frontal faces.
Image Processing Techniques: OpenCV functions like imread() for reading images, cvtColor() for converting the
color of the image to grayscale, and detectMultiScale() for detecting faces within the grayscale image.
Text Rendering: OpenCV's putText() function is used to render text onto the image, indicating the number of faces detected.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The code utilizes OpenCV's imshow() function to display the image with detected faces in a window. 
The waitKey() function is used to introduce a delay and process keyboard inputs, and destroyAllWindows() is used to close the GUI windows.
